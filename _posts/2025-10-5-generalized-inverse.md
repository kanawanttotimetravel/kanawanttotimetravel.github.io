The concept of the generalized inverse of a matrix arises from the fundamental need to extend the idea of the matrix inverse beyond the realm of square and nonsingular matrices. In classical linear algebra, the inverse of a square matrix $$\textbf{A}$$ exists only if $$\textbf{A}$$ is non-singular, meaning its determinant is non-zero. However, in many real-world problems, we frequently deal with rectangular matrices or singular square matrices where the standard inverse does not exist. These situations commonly occur when solving systems of linear equations that are either overdetermined (more equations than unknowns) or underdetermined (more unknowns than equations). In such cases, the need arises for a more general concept of inversion even when a true inverse cannot be defined.
