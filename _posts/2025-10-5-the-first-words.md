## Introduction
Welcome to whoever has spent their precious time visiting this blog. I'm **Khổng Ngọc Anh**, or **kana**, if you prefer. As the name implied, this blog is my personal sanctuary where I ramble about, well, everything. Including life, work, science, philosophy, even politics, whatever. Whether it's a funny science fact, a techincal post on niche topics like *How to perfectly upload your consciousness to a cloud system?*, or a whole existential crisis. Any of them can be found here, as long as I feel like writing about it. Once again, welcome, and enjoy your stay.   

## So, what bring you here?
As for me, I started writing because I feel like I need an actual healthy habit.  Like many young adults, I’m struggling with pretty much everything: Life, studying, work, keeping a healthy and consistent routine. I was arrogant, reckless, then confused, depressed. No, “depressed” might be a bit of an exaggeration. I was more disappointed in myself than anything else. Therefore, I need a kick to change. So, I will start writing! Sounds like I have conceived an idea the most ingenious, hopefully it will last longer than my urge to end everything (which lasted even shorter than the [Planck time](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time)). 

On a serious note, I have come to this decision due to several reasons. The first is that I want to improve my English, particularly my writing. To be honest, my writing sucks, even in my mother tongue. English and writing, both are things I'm still seriously lacking in. The second reason is that I was inspired by several excellent blogs. I was most influenced by [my friend's](https://escaperr94.github.io/) blog (He rarely writes and only write in Vietnamese). I also want to give a shout-out to [Kim Ji-ha](https://jiha-kim.github.io/), [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/blog/), [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/) and many more bloggers for their great work. As such, I decided that I wanted to write something myself.

## So, what will I do? 
> I think, therefore I write. 

To be honest, I have no idea. I started writing for several reasons, but none of them was because I already had something in mind to write about. It’s more like I just felt the need to start something, somewhere, to think and let my thoughts spill out, even if they don’t make sense yet.

Maybe this blog will end up being a collection of random thoughts, reflections, or rants. A mix of my life, shitposts, and occasional moments of unexpected depth. I don’t expect every post to be meaningful or profound; some might be funny, some might be messy, and some might just exist because I wanted to say something out loud.

But I want to make this blog something meaningful, instead of a random collection of words. I want it to be a space that reflects my growth, my curiosity, and the way I see the world changing around me.

I want to share what I’ve learned, what I’m learning, and what I still struggle to understand. Whether it’s a concept I’ve grasped, something I’m still trying to figure out, or an idea that completely escapes me, I want to document that journey here.

Because learning, to me, isn't just about reaching the point of understanding. It’s about the process itself: The questions, the confusion, the frustration, the agony when things feel out of reach, the little sparks of realization, and finally, the ecstasy when you finally overcome it. Maybe by writing, I can come to understand things a bit better. And maybe, someone who stumbles upon these words will find a fragment of themselves in my thoughts, too.


## Conclusion
Well, this is my first rambling. The very beginning of what might become a long trail of thoughts, reflections, and nonsense, or maybe something meaningful. Ideally, I want to write a post about either math or science right now, but in reality, I don’t really have a clear direction yet. Still, this is where it all starts: with a blank page and a desire to put thoughts into words.

Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read my blogs.  Whether you’re here by chance, curiosity, or genuine interest, thank you for being part of this small rambling. I hope that in some way, what you find here can help you, even a little bit. May it makes you think, smile, or simply feel a little less alone.
