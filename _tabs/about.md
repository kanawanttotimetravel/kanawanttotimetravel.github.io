Hi, this is Kana speaking. Welcome to **This is a blog where I ramble**, a personal space dedicated to...well, me. This is where I will write about anything I want to, whatever comes to mind. Including, but not limited to, life, work, science, philosophy, and so on.

## What is this?
As mentioned, I want to write about anything that comes to mind. So, expect a wide variety of topics: from lighthearted thoughts and random musings to deeper reflections on life, work, and everything in between. I’ll write about whatever catches my curiosity or stirs something inside me. Sometimes it might be serious, sometimes completely meaningless. Sometimes it will be about something I’m currently learning, and other times about a topic I have no idea about.

But, I want my writing to not be a wall of incomprehensible texts. I want whoever reads my writing to gain something, whether it’s a new perspective, a better understanding, or simply a fun time reading.  

## What is this not?
While I want my blogs to be as clear and accurate as possible, it’s inevitable that there will be errors, overlooked details, or nuances I might misunderstand or fail to express properly. After all, I’m still learning, struggling, and getting confused about many things. 

I don’t claim to know everything, nor do I expect to always get things right. What I write here reflects my thoughts and understanding at a certain moment in time, and those will naturally change as I grow and learn more. So, if you have expertise in these areas, spot something that needs correction, or have suggestions for clarification, please feel free to share your insights. Feedback helps me learn and improves the quality of the content for everyone. After all, my hope is that my own struggle can at least bring something useful for those on a similar path.
